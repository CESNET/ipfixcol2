 * \brief Parse IPFIX Messages and handle Template managers of Transport Sessions
 *
 * The parser takes clean IPFIX Message wrapper, checks Message consistency, parser Data and
 * (Options) Template Sets and and fills positions of Data Records and references to particular
 * templates necessary to interpret them. For each combination of a Transport Session and an ODID,
 * the parser manages a Template manger and expected sequence numbers.
 *
 * Keep on mind that all referenced templates are part of Template Managers and they are part of
 * the parser. In other words, the parser MUST not be destroyed until all records (that have
 * references to its templates) no longer exist.
