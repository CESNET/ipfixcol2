 * \brief Instance of an input plugin
 *
 * The class takes care of (i.e. initialize, configure and destroy):
 * - a plugin context of an input plugin
 * - a plugin context of the IPFIX message parser (implemented as an internal plugin)
 * - a ring buffer connecting input and parser instances
 * - a feedback pipe (for collector core to send termination/reconfiguration messages
 *   and for the IPFIX message parser to send request to close a Transport Session)
 *
 * \note
 *   The output ring buffer is not defined and MUST be connected before the plugin instances
 *   can be initialized!
 * \note The IPFIX parser is connected to the input feedback pipe only if the input plugin
 *   implements the interface for processing request to close a Transport Session
 *
