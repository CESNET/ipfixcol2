The mapping from original IP addresses to anonymized IP addresses is one-to-one and if two original IP addresses share a k-bit prefix, their anonymized mappings will also share a k-bit prefix. Be aware that this cryptography method is very demanding and can limit throughput of the collector.\nTruncation: This method keeps the top part and erases the bottom part of an IP address. Compared to the CryptoPAn method, it is considerably faster, however, mapping from the original to anonymized IP address is many-to-one. For example the IPv4 address \"1.2.3.4\" is mapped to the address \"1.2.0.0\".",
