 * \brief Garbage message interface
 *
 * A message for destruction of objects that are intended to be destroyed, but can be referenced
 * by other still existing objects farther down in the collector's pipeline.
 *
 * For example, a withdrawn template that can be referenced by still existing packets
 * _farther down_ in the pipeline. This message will call a callback to destroy the object before
 * the destruction of this message. It ensures that there are no objects _farther down_ in the
 * pipeline with references to this object, because that objects have been already destroyed.
 *
 * \warning Already destroyed objects MUST never be used again.
 * \remark Identification type of this message is #IPX_MSG_GARBAGE.
