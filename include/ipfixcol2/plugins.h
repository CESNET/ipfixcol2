 *
 * These functions specifies a communication interface between IPFIXcol core and external plugins.
 * The IPFIXcol core uses following functions to control processing messages by plugins. An author
 * of the plugin can count on the fact that for an instance of the plugin the functions are never
 * called concurrently. On the other hand, multiple instances of the same plugin could exists
 * inside the collector at the same time and run concurrently (by different threads), therefore,
 * an author of the plugin MUST avoid using non-constant global and static variables, system
 * signals and other resources that can potentially cause data race.
 *
 * This module contains the plugin identification structure and function that MUST be
 * implemented so a plugin can be loaded and used by the collector. Not all function mentioned
 * in this section must be implemented.
 *
 * Input plugins (::IPX_PT_INPUT) MUST implement at least these functions:
 * - plugin_init()
 * - plugin_destroy()
 * - plugin_get()
 * Optionally, if supported, the function plugin_session_close() should be implemented as well.
 *
 * Intermediate (::IPX_PT_INTERMEDIATE) and output (::IPX_PT_OUTPUT) plugins MUST implement at
 * least these functions:
 * - plugin_init()
 * - plugin_destroy()
 * - plugin_process()
 *
 * \note
 *   The plugin identification structure and all implemented functions MUST be defined as external
 *   symbols of the plugin's library (i.e. shared object) and MUST have public visibility.
